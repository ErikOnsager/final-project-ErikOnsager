# Introduction
Our project analyses a data set that consists of the average SAT scores for New York City public schools during the year 2014 - 2015. We decided on this area of study because the data set provides many columns that allow us to analyse the information with a range of data creating important questions. Our group has seen that history has shown us how rigged such standardised systems can be, with celebrities buying scores for their children and students paying fake test takers to forge higher scores. In order to understand the corruption and dispersion in test scores, we are motivated to analyse the sociodemographic factors that affect this and bring light to the issue and challenges students face. The original data comes from two different places. The high school data was collected by the New York City Department of Education. The SAT data was provided by the College Board. The original data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/nycopendata/high-schools.

Some research questions that we are interested in are: 
1. How does the cultural divide among students affect their individual scores?
2. How do the different locations (eg. columns = Borough) affect access to resources that influence students’ scores? 
3. How do income levels between different racial groups trigger student scores? 
4. Do public schools with higher enrollment numbers perform better? 

In order to answer these questions, we will evaluate multiple forms of values such as student enrollment, average SAT scores, race, income, and location. These questions spur interest because it allows us to analyse how different factors from race to location can influence a student’s scores. In order to consider ethical questions and limitations, we will look at how we can recognize bias and avoid our own personal bias. For limitations, the data only provides the average scores and the race breakdown of each school so comparisons can only be made on one set of standardized scores, which limits the conclusions that can be made. Moreover, there are only 4 races noted in the data: White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian and there is no gender. Another problem in the data set is that some of the schools have missing information about SAT scores or race breakdowns which can create gaps. At the end of this project, we will be able to see how public schools perform when compared to others and how New York City’s diversity plays a role in the testing numbers.
